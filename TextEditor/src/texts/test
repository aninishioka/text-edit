Hello, World. My name is Anissa.Let's see if this works!It seems like it is. Thank god lol.Okay, now to figure out what's happening to the cursor when the text length exceeds the windowâ€”currently, it's being put below the last line of text and there's a significant gap between the two. It is most likely that I'm misunderstanding something about how the x and y coordinates are being calculated. I also have to make the initial layout and subsequent layout calculations more simplified so I don't need to remember how I've been doing it and tailor it to that. Does that make any sense? I'm putting the practice test files in a directory to be ignored by git so I hope I didn't fuck anything up and that's actually the case cause I don't need anyone seeing this jumble of words. After I get all the basic functions working I would like to build this little project out so it supports some more complicated operations, including changing and saving font size, style, etc. Currently font size can be adjusted but these changes won't be reflected in a file after it's closed and reopened. I'm really just saving the text and that's it.Would also be cool if I could open text docs I've created in other word processing apps?? Don't really know what that will look like at the moment though. Whenever I do personal projects like this I realize how much work even simple applications take to create. There's a lot of complexity under the hood. Trusting the process that as I put in more work I will actually be able to build out bigger and more exciting projects. I really want to get better at this. Okay now where did the fucking cursor go?? Woo it's working now! Just had to add the cursor as a child of the textRoot instead of root. Easy fix.
