Shit that happened at church/with church people that fucked me up lol- That lady who told me short hair looks bad on round faces. Don't project your insecurities on me binch.- Small group leader's then bf, now husband telling her that she's right, I am quirky while still shaking hands with me. Like that's how you talk about me?? And this dick has the gall to say it right in front of me like I won't understand. Even if I'm "quirky" I can still catch when someone talking shit about me lol- The training session on Japanese culture. Detestable that religion is more of a cultural fixture than a spiritual one for most Japanese people. Deplorable !!! (According to them)- Tohoku earthquake + tsunami are a god-given opportunity to prey on vulnerable people that have just gone through a traumatizing experienceâ€”lost their homes, lost loved ones, gone through a near-death experience. Where's the compassion??- People laughing about how I'm going to become "woke and politically correct" by going to Berkeley. Also people who seemed put off by Berkeley's more progressive culture and vocal history.- The one lady who always tells me I am small and look the same as x number of years ago. Thank you, I did not know that I haven't grown since middle school and that I look very young. No one has ever told me that before!!:o- Small group leader telling me the people become queer because they don't experience any success with straight relationships. Like truly so strange and such harmful messaging!!-
